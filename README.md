jboss_security_tests
====================

First Purpose:
Remote call from a client to a secured stateless session bean. Further testing local calls between secured stateless beans, stateful session beans and singleton startup beans.
Be aware that the RunAs annotation defines the ROLE not the user for which the securtiy identity is propagated. For further information see http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnbyl.html#bnbzb

Second Purpose:
Demonstrate the authorization issue invoking methods of a secured bean from the preDestroy method of a stateful session bean.
PreDestroy annotated methods execute in an unspecified transaction and securtiy context. So it's necessary to find a way to regain a sufficient security context.
